The early stages of a dynamic Ethereum Roadmap dashboard.
All contributors are welome.
Most importantly, we should prioritize concise descriptions within each of the six development lanes. A layman should be able to understand what each lane is attempting to accomplish.
Secondly, each specific upgrade should provide a reasonable understanding of how the end goal can be accomplished.
Lastly, this dashboard should become a comprehensive repository of upgrade/EIP specific dashboards. A homepage for the more detailed work others have put in.

Ideally this dashboard would be refreshed after each All Core Devs call.
